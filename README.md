# A Snail's Stroll
This project was built for Day 10 of Hack Club's Haxmas on December 22, 2025.
<br>
A Snail's Stroll is a small runner game built using Lua. All pixel art and additional mechanics (rolling and animations) were added independent of the workshop. In this game, you play as a determined little snail who must run, jump, and roll to avoid the salt!\

Controls:
- Jump: [Space/Up Arrow]
- Roll: [Down Arrow]
